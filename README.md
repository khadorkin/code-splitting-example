## Code-splitting example

Components tree is rendered based on API response. Supports code-splitting on the components level. Works with [Server Rendering](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-dom-server.html). Alternative approach to [route-based loading](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/code-splitting) or [async](https://github.com/ctrlplusb/react-async-component) [loading](https://github.com/thejameskyle/react-loadable).
